## 📂 What's Inside This Repository?

This repository includes the full **source code**, **ROS 2 packages**, and **system configurations** for **Phoenyx I**, the award-winning autonomous rover engineered by undergraduate students from **PUCRA**, the robotics association at the **Polytechnic University of Catalonia**. 

Base on [NASA JPL Open Source Rover](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover),this project enhances the base platform with a robust autonomy stack:
- 🔍 **Real-time perception** (color, digit recognition & ArUco makers) 
- 🗺️ **SLAM & LiDAR-based navigation**.
- 🧭 **Global and local path planning** with obstacle avoidance.
- 🧠 **Finite State Machine** (FSM) architecture in ROS 2.
- ⚙️ **Optimized performance on Raspberry Pi 4B.**

Phoenyx I demonstrates how high-performance autonomy can be achieved using **accessible hardware, efficient algorithms, and a ROS 2 architecture**, serving as a scalable platform for education, research, and field robotics experimentation.

## 🎯 Competition Challenge Overview
The **SENER-CEA's Bot Talent** competition features a serie of challenges focused on **AMRs (Autonomus Mobile Robots)**, in which universities from across Spain compete by completing some tasks using an open source Rover. Our team successfully tackled all the proposed challenges:
- **[🔍 Perception Task](#-perception-task)**: Visual marker classification.
- **[🛣️ Control Task](#-control-task)**: Corridor navigation via LiDAR
- **[📍Guidance Task](#-guidance-task)**: Localization + waypoint following using ArUco.
- **🧩Final Challenge**:  Full autonomous mission combining all above tasks.
  
### 🔍 Perception Task

Given the **Raspberry Pi 4B's** limited **4GB memory**, we opted for a lightweight **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** classifier instead of deep CNNs. This approach was combined with classical **computer vision technique** such as **morphological treatments**, **custom filtering**, and **image preprocessing** to isolate digits from their background. Additionally, a **stadistic analysis** was employed for accurate **color detection**. This combination enabled **fast** and **reliable digit and color recognition** with **minimal computational overhead**.

### 🛣️ Control Task
In this challenge, the robot had to **autonomously navigate narrow hallways using only 2D LiDAR**, without predefined maps or waypoints. We developed a custom ROS 2 node, `linea_media.py`, that combines **local perception** and **global goal planning** via Nav2.

The node continuously processes the LiDAR scan data (-80º to 80º), **identifies** the most **open path**, **projects the best direction** to the global `map` frame, and **publish a `PoseStamped` goal** to Nav2.

Optimized for the **Raspberry Pi 4B**, it leverages lightweight methods like **block averaging, polar gap detection, and adaptive filtering** to ensure **real-time, robust, and safe operation**, validated in both simulation and on the competition floor.

### 📍 Guidance Task 

In this challenge, the robot had to **localize itself using ArUco markers** markers from an unknown starting position. This was handled by `brain.py` (a finite state machine (FSM) that coordinates all nodes) and `localizacion_aruco.py`, which scan **ArUco markers** and triggers an **odometry reset** via manual **frame transformations**.

To ensure safty, the system loads a predifined `map` to keep the robot within fiel boundaries.

# or
ros2 launch osr_gazebo maze_simulation.launch.py maze:=maze_3.world

# Terminal 2 - Run the control challenge node
