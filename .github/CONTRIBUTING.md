    1.  **Fork** this repository to your GitHub account.
    2.  **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine:
        `git clone https://github.com/PUCRA/Phoenyx.git`
    3.  Create a new **branch** for your changes (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature` or `bugfix/fix-typo`).
    4.  Make your changes and **commit** them with a clear, descriptive message (e.g., `feat: Add new awesome feature`, `fix: Resolve #123 bug`).
    5.  **Push** your branch to your forked repository: `git push origin your-branch-name`.
    6.  Open a **Pull Request** from your forked repository to the `main` branch of this project. Describe your changes clearly.
